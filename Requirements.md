## Back-End (B)

### Data Processing Backend (BA)
1. The submissions API should accept multiple file types: 
    - Videos: ".mp4", ".mkv", ".avi", ".flv", ".mov", ".wmv".
    - Audios: ".mp3", ".mp4a", ".m4p", ".raw", ".wav".
    - Docs: ".pdf", ".docx", ".rtf", ".txt".
2. If an unsupported filetype is submitted, the API should reject the request with a 415 status code and a message about supported file types.
3. If there's an issue reading any of the submitted files, the API should reject the request with a 400 status code and a message about the files being unreadable.
4. The file conversions API should extract audio from submitted video files and convert it to ".mp3".
5. The transcription API should extract text from audio files and save it as a ".txt" file, utilizing a locally-hosted Whisper model.
6. The backend should be capable of initializing a Chroma Vector database and a PostgreSQL user database, and storing and retrieving data from them.
7. It should store the submitted video, audio, and text files in the PostgreSQL user database.

### LLM API (BB)
1. It should format inputs for LLM agents tiktoken and OpenAI documentation and format outputs from the vector database for display on the front-end.
2. Upon accepting outputs from LLM agents, it should embed them using the embedder agent and store the embeddings in the Chroma vector database.
3. It should retrieve data from the Chroma vector database, convert it into text via the LLM embedder agent, and format it for display on the frontend.
4. It should submit requested text, audio, and video data to the frontend upon request.

### LLM Agents (BC)
1. The LLM labeling agent should map provided texts by tagging text chunks.
2. The LLM table of contents agent should form a table of contents for provided texts using tag maps and text chunks.
3. The LLM summarizing agent should summarize provided text chunks using a provided table of contents for context.
4. The LLM key term agent should extract key terms from provided text chunks, using summaries for context.
5. The LLM study card agent should compile term-definition pairs using provided key terms and summaries for context.
6. The embedder LLM agent should vectorize provided text tokens into a vector database-compatible format.
7. LLM agents should accept their according inputs from the data processing backend and submit their according outputs to the data processing backend.

### Chroma Vector Database (BD)
1. It should be able to create, edit, and delete tables with provided dimensions and meta-tags.
2. It should store and retrieve embeddings using semantic search and meta-tag search.

### User Data Database (BE)
